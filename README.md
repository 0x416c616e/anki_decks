# Alan's Anki Decks

Anki is a program for making and using digital flash cards. It's been a vital part of my success in college. Not only is it good to take notes, and then think about things a second time when you convert notes to flash cards, but it's also good to review with them. It can really help with memory retention and comprehension.

The decks in this repo are Anki flash card decks I made for some of my college classes, specifically ones related to math and computer science.
